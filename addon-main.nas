# This is the main addon Nasal hook. It MUST contain a function
# called "main". The main function will be called upon init with
# the addons.Addon instance corresponding to the addon being loaded.
#
# This script will live in its own Nasal namespace that gets
# dynamically created from the global addon init script.
# It will be something like "__addon[ADDON_ID]__" where ADDON_ID is
# the addon identifier, such as "org.flightgear.addons.Skeleton".
#
# See $FG_ROOT/Docs/README.add-ons for info about the addons.Addon
